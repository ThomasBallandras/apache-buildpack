# Apache BuildPack
This BuildPack will install the Apache2 web server using the apt-buildpack.

## Configuration

If an `apache.conf.erb` is present at the root of your project, it will be
rendered (useing ERB template system) and included in the default
configuration.

## Apache modules

You can install custom apache modules by adding a `.apache-mods` file at the root
of your project. It must include one module per line.
The list of modules available, with a short description of each module, is available at 
the following locations depending on the version of the stack used:
* Stack ubuntu-20: https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=focal&searchon=names&keywords=libapache2-mod
* Stack ubuntu-18: https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=bionic&searchon=names&keywords=libapache2-mod

Please note you only need to pass the module name inside the `.apache-mods` file, 
dropping the `libapache2-mod-` part.

Example:

```
auth-openidc
auth-mellon
```

## Environment tweaks

* `APACHE_LOG_LEVEL`: (default: `info`) Define the apache log level among the following:
  * `emerg`	System is unusable
  * `alert`	Action must be taken immediately
  * `crit`	Critical conditions
  * `error`	Error conditions
  * `warn`	Warning conditions
  * `notice`	Normal, but significant conditions
  * `info`	Informational messages
  * `debug`	Debugging messages
  * `trace1` – `trace8` Trace messages with gradually increasing levels of detail

## The `apache.conf.erb` file

The `apache.conf.erb` file can be used to include specific configuration for your
environment. It should be placed at the root of your application repository.
You may want to include variables as Ruby code in this file, which will
match environment variables from your container.
For example, you can create a variable `MY_VAR` in your container and use it in the
`apache.conf.erb` file with `<%= ENV["MY_VAR"] %>`. It will be matched to the corresponding 
environment variable and replaced with its value before starting Apache.

If you need to load modules in the Apache configuration, and these modules were included
in the `.apache-mods` file, they will autmatically be loaded in the Apache configuration.
You don't need to add the corresponding `LoadModule` directive to your `apache.conf.erb` 
file.

If no `apache.conf.erb` file is found, Apache will work as a simple HTTP server and will
serve the content of the `www` directory present on your application repository.

## Example setting up a basic OpenID-Connect Relying Party

To configure Apache as an OpenID-Connect Relying Party (RP), you can create an 
`apache.conf.erb` with the following code:

```
OIDCProviderMetadataURL <issuer>/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDCClientID <%= ENV["OIDC_CLIENT_ID"] %>
OIDCClientSecret <%= ENV["OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET"] %>

OIDCRedirectURI https://<hostname>/secure/redirect_uri
OIDCCryptoPassphrase <%= ENV["OIDC_CRYPTO_PASSPHRASE"] %>

<Location /secure>
   AuthType openid-connect
   Require valid-user
</Location>
```
And create the following environment variables in your container:
* `OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<client_id_value>`
* `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret_value>`
* `OIDC_CRYPTO_PASSPHRASE=<crypto_passphrase_value>`

## Mellon configuration

In order for auth-mellon to work, mellon needs to have a key, certificate and metadata file available.
You can generate the files accordingly:
* Run the `tools/mellon_create_metadata.sh` script, passing it the entity-id and endpoint-path as parameters
* 3 files will be created. For each file, run the command: `base64 --wrap 0 <file_name>`
* Create the environment variables `MELLON_SP_KEY`, `MELLON_SP_CERT` and `MELLON_SP_METADATA` and paste the corresponding value returned by the above command.

You will also need to run the `base64 --wrap 0 <file_name>` against the Identity Provider metadata file and copy-paste the returned value into a `MELLON_IDP_METADATA` environment variable.

You can then set these files in your Mellon configuration, as such:
```
[...]
MellonSPMetadataFile <%= ENV["HOME"] %>/vendor/apache2/mellon/mellon.xml
MellonSPPrivateKeyFile <%= ENV["HOME"] %>/vendor/apache2/mellon/mellon.key
MellonSPCertFile <%= ENV["HOME"] %>/vendor/apache2/mellon/mellon.cert
MellonIdPMetadataFile <%= ENV["HOME"] %>/vendor/apache2/mellon/mellon_idp_metadata.xml
[...]
```

## Variables

The table belows lists all the vairables you can set, and a description of each.

| Var Name | Module | Default | Description |
|----------|:------:|:-------:|-------------|
| APACHE_LOG_LEVEL | General | info | Sets the Apache log level. |
| APACHE_WORKER_SIZE | General | 30 | Sets the average Apache process size, in Mb. Used to calculate MaxRequestWorkers. |
| MELLON_SP_KEY | auth-mellon | none | Used to set the Mellon Service Provider key. Should be the key converted to base64. |
| MELLON_SP_CERT | auth-mellon | none | Used to set the Mellon Service Provider certificate. Should be the certificate converted to base64. |
| MELLON_SP_METADATA | auth-mellon | none | Used to set the Mellon Service Provider metadata xml file. Should be the xml file converted to base64. |
| MELLON_IDP_METADATA | auth-mellon | none | Used to set the Mellon Identity Provider metadata xml file. Should be the xml file converted to base64. |
| YOUR_KEY | any | none | You can set your own variables inside the apache.conf.erb file. Use string `<%= ENV["YOUR_KEY"] %>` inside apache.conf.erb. |
